# Dog facts website

## Introduction

TOn this page, I designed and wrote a variety of facts about dogs and presented them in a responsive arrangement with various smart devices.

## Approach
In general, I designed the page as a reading journey for the user. This journey relies on the auditory, visual and interactive senses.

From the audio point of view, I have incorporated a clip of relaxing music that the user can play while reading the article.

Visually, I kept the contrast high for easier reading and added a lot of pictures.

From the interactive side, I used an interactive table of content. When you click on the title you want to go to, the scroll moves to those points easily. I also added a slide show that the user can interact with.


## Website advantages

Responsiveness to smart devices.
High contrast supports accessibility.
The content is interactive with the user (interactive scrolls from the table of content menu and slideshow).
Treat the user as if they are on a journey through the content.
